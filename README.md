# The MedBench translator

This repo is for aiding in translating the MedBench medical charts into multiple languages.

See https://gforge.github.io/MedBenchTranslate/ for a live version of the translation tool.

Note that the translation tool does not save to a database but locally in your browser. If you want to save your translations, you need to save the output from the translation to a local file. This is done under translation by clicking the **Save** button.
